The project details Blog Post can be found at,
http://analoghome.blogspot.com/2020/07/yatc-yet-another-thermal-camera.html

Note: The code / hardware here is presented for educational purposes only. It is not a "Build It" kind of Kit or documented that way. While the project can be built from the information presented here, it would take an advanced 'do it yourself' kind of person to do that.

Most of the project is licensed under the: "Do whatever you want with it" license. However there are third party drivers and their licenses are in the respective source files text.

Notes:
The Firmware is meant to be compiled with the following setup,
  * MPLAB-X V5.30
  * Microchip Harmony V2.06
  * Microchip XC32 V2.41
  * The project path should be this on your hard drive: "C:\microchip\Projects\ThermalCam_Melexis_V2"
  
The PCB was designed with Altium Designer V20.x, the schematic is in the PCB.zip file in Altium and as a pdf output for easy viewing. The Altium fils can be viewed with the Altium Online Viewer.

The 3D printed housing was designed with Design Spark Mechanical V5.x.

Thanks to Melexis for making the sensor that made this all possible and to Adafruit for suplying really cool parts that make projects fun and easy to do.
